    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <br>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven</strong></li>

    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>Cook the Ground Meat:</li>

    In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Break it into smaller pieces as it cooks.
    Drain any excess fat, then add the minced garlic, diced onion, and diced tomatoes to the skillet. Cook for about 5 minutes until the onions soften.
    Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, and Italian seasoning. Let it simmer on low heat for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
    <li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</li>

    In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, egg, and a pinch of salt and pepper.
    Stir in 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well.
    <li>Cook the Lasagna Noodles:</li>

    Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain them and set them aside.
    <li>Assemble the Lasagna:</li>

    In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom.
    Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.
    Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles.
    Add another layer of meat sauce on top of the cheese.
    Repeat the layers: noodles, cheese mixture, meat sauce, until you run out of ingredients. The top layer should be the meat sauce.
    <li>Add Final Cheese Layer:</li>

    Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of mozzarella cheese and the rest of the Parmesan cheese on top of the lasagna.
    <li>Bake the Lasagna:</li>

    Cover the dish with aluminum foil (to prevent sticking, you can spray the foil with cooking spray) and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
    Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.
    <li>Let it Rest:</li>

    Once done, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes before serving. This helps the layers set and makes it easier to cut.
    <li>Serve:</li>

    Slice and serve your lasagna hot, perhaps with a side of garlic bread or a fresh salad.
    Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!
