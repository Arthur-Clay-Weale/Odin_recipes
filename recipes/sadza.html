    <p>
        Sadza, a staple of Zimbabwean cuisine, is a hearty, thickened cornmeal porridge that's the cornerstone of many meals. When paired with green chomolia (a leafy vegetable similar to kale) and savory mince meat, it creates a wholesome and flavorful dish. The rich, earthy flavor of the chomolia complements the tender, spiced mince, while the sadza serves as the perfect base, absorbing the juices and bringing everything together. This comforting meal is not only satisfying but also a true taste of home, embodying the warmth and simplicity of Zimbabwean culinary traditions.

        <li>Prepare the Sadza:</li>

        In a pot, bring 2 cups of water to a boil.
        In a separate bowl, mix 1 cup of maize meal with 1 cup of cold water to make a smooth paste.
        Gradually add the maize meal paste to the boiling water, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.
        Reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 5 minutes.
        Gradually add the remaining maize meal while stirring, until the mixture thickens and pulls away from the sides of the pot.
        Continue to cook and stir for about 10-15 minutes until the sadza is well-cooked and smooth.
        Remove from heat and cover to keep warm.
        <li>Cook the Green Chomolia:</li>

        Wash and chop the chomolia leaves into bite-sized pieces.
        Heat 1 tablespoon of cooking oil in a pan over medium heat.
        Add the chopped onion and garlic, sauté until softened and translucent.
        Add the chopped chomolia to the pan and stir to combine with the onions and garlic.
        Cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chomolia is wilted and tender.
        Season with salt to taste and remove from heat.
        <li>Prepare the Mince Meat:</li>

        In a separate pan, heat 1 tablespoon of cooking oil over medium heat.
        Add the chopped onion and garlic, sauté until softened.
        Add the ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it apart with a spoon.
        Add the chopped tomato and tomato paste, stirring to combine.
        Season with salt, pepper, and any optional spices like curry powder or paprika.
        Simmer the mince meat mixture for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
        Once the mince is cooked through and the sauce has thickened, remove from heat.
        <li>Serve:</li>

        Serve the sadza alongside the green chomolia and mince meat on a plate.
